# xJea

In the current world of Information Technology, protective measures do not stop at the network edge. Recent news reports based on security breach post-mortems indicate the need to protect assets using measures that reduce administrative access. While the principle of least privilege has always been known to IT Security professionals, there is a need in the industry for a standardized method of constructing an operator experience that reduces access with a more sophisticated level of granularity than what is available in many traditional access control models.

Just Enough Administration (JEA) is a solution designed to help protect Server systems. This is accomplished by allowing specific users to perform administrative tasks on servers without giving them administrator privileges and auditing all actions that these users performed. JEA is based on PowerShell constrained runspaces, a technology that is already being used to secure administrative tasks in environments such as Exchange online.

We are focusing on fortifying your existing environment allowing you to adopt at your own pace a solution that reduces administrator exposure and protects against lateral movement from breached machines
